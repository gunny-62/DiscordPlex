cmake --preset=release ..
cmake --build release

## FAQ

### Why does Presence For Plex show "No active sessions"?

If the application is connecting to your Plex server but not detecting your media playback:

1. Check your Plex server's network settings
2. Go to Plex server Settings â†’ Network
3. Verify that "Preferred network interface" is set correctly
    - If set to "Auto", try selecting your specific network interface instead
    - This is particularly important for servers with multiple network interfaces

### Why do the buttons not work?

They do, but only for others! For some reason Discord doesn't like to show you your own rich presence buttons.
